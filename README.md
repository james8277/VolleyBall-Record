# Volleyball Recording App

## Overview
Hi I am James, an amateur volleyball player. I have been playing volleyball for several years and I want to have a way to record player performance in the games. So I built up this Android app for people who want to record player's data in the volleyball games. It is designed to be very convenient and straightforward for everyone. Hope everyone can enjoy this app. Also please let me know if you have questions.
